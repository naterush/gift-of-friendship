# Gift-Of-Friendship
A simple Ethereum dapp that make's gift giving easy and fun. The contract is tentativly called ‘Gift of Friendship.’ Make sure you don't forget your family and friends birthdays.

## Goals: 
1. Provide a fun way to get your friends to use the ethereum blockchain.

2. Provide the best way to facilitate gift giving (let's be honest, how many times do you really like the gifts you get?).


## How it Works
1. As a present for their friend, an ethereum user sets up a Gift of Friendship smart contract.

2. On their friends birthday, they wish them a happy birthday as well as send them a present in the form of ether.

3. This money is locked up in the smart contract and cannot be taken out, for now. 

4. As friendship goes both ways, the "friend" repeats step 2 but on the creator of the contracts birthday.

5. This continues forever; if each member of the contract continues to wish eachother happy birthday, then the money will contiue to build up - at least untill someone dies.

6. If one member forgets to wish the other member a happy birthday, they can wish them a happy belated birthday within a set time period. This sends half of their present to the other member of the deal immediatly, while half gets stored in the contract. 

7. If one member completly forgets the others birthday, never wishing their friend happy birthday then the money locked in the contract can be taken out by the friend who did not have happy birthday wished to them.

## Future Plans
This smart contract is currently a P21OP smart contract. Two peers interact on it. It may be better (to save on gas costs and accessability) into making one smart contract for all players, in which they can form relationships with as many peers as they want. 

Also, there may be a benefit for wishing your friend a happy birthday earlier in the day than later, so they know you really have been thinking about them. 

Finially, future changes have been proposed where the present amount has to increase according to some function of time.
